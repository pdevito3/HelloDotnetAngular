that means that we can inject IWeatherForecastService into our endpoints
and that .NET will automatically create an instance of the WeatherForecastService implementation
for us to use in our endpoint

The scoped lifetime means that a new instance of WeatherForecastService will be created
for each HTTP request that comes in. This is the most common lifetime for services.
There are other lifetimes like Singleton (one instance for the whole application)
and Transient (a new instance for each time it's requested) -- these will be needed 
pretty infrequently
